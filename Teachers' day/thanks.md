<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best wishes to my high school IT teacher, Irene, who opened the door of CS for me. 
I have decided to major CS in my college now. There are so much fun in computer science. 
It is very fortunate that I met her in high school and found computer science my life pursuit.
